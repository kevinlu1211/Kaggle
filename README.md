# Kaggle

This is the repo where I have stored all the scripts that I have used for the Kaggle Competitions. I have currently just started, but it will be updated daily. Right now the problem that I am working on is the Titanic competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

# Notes
Here are the my [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wsKl-uc9EhhekGsLrCnV2rogw7FETcTx9qPwmeHuDdU/edit?usp=sharing) that I have on machine learning (although it is for self consumption so it is a bit messy)

# Todo
  1. Read about LDA about the [within-group and between-group] (https://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/reduced-rank-discriminant-analysis/) interpretation and update notes
  2. Read [this](http://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/19874) to get an basic understanding of boosting algorithms
