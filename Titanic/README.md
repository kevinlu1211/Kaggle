### Files:
- Here are the files that I currently have:
  1. titanic.R is where I use the algorithms from the library so that I have a better understanding of how the library works; while doing this I will also read up on the machine learning methods that I am currently using to have an understanding of these methods
---

### Currently working on:

- Implementing different methods to predict for the Titanic data set
  1. ~~Linear Discriminant Analysis via lda() function in R~~ 31/08/16 unable to use LDA due to categorial predictor variables
    1.1 Implement LDA and use just the continuous variables for prediction
  2. LASSO/Ridge Regression/Elastic Net using [glmnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/glmnet.pdf)
  3. ~~Read/Implement Decision Trees using [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf)~~ 20/08/16
  4. ~~Read/Implement Random Forests using [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf)~~ 23/08/16
  5. ~~Read/Implement Logistic Regression using glm()~~ 27/08/16
  6. ~~Read/Implement SVMs from [e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/e1071.pdf)~~ 29/08/16
  7. Gradient Boosted Machines using [gmb](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/gbm.pdf)
  8. Use Neural Networks from [here](http://www.parallelr.com/r-deep-neural-network-from-scratch/)
  9. Use emsembles from [here](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-ensembles-with-r/)
