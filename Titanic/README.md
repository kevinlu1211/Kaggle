### Currently working on:

- Using the Caret library to do spot checking of different algorithms via: http://topepo.github.io/caret/training.html#custom   
- Algorithms to be spot checked:
⋅⋅* Gradient Boosted Machines via gbm library
⋅⋅* LASSO/Ridge Regression/Elastic Net via glmnet
⋅⋅* Decision Trees via rpart
⋅⋅* Random Forests via randomForest
⋅⋅* Logistic Regression via glm() function
⋅⋅* SVMs via e1071
---

### Todos:
- ~~Use Decision Trees via rpart~~ 20/08/16
- ~~Use Logistic Regression via glm()~~ 27/08/16
- ~~Use SVMs from e1071~~ 29/08/16
- Use Neural Networks from http://www.parallelr.com/r-deep-neural-network-from-scratch/
- Use emsembles from http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-ensembles-with-r/
