### Currently working on:

1. Using the Caret library to do spot checking of different algorithms
⋅⋅1. Gradient Boosted Machines via gbm library
⋅⋅2. LASSO/Ridge Regression/Elastic Net via glmnet
⋅⋅3. Decision Trees via rpart
⋅⋅4. Random Forests via randomForest
⋅⋅5. Logistic Regression via glm() function
⋅⋅6. SVMs via e1071
